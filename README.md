# MiniDragon

Schematics, hardware simulator and software files for the MiniDragon CPU. This is a from-scratch CPU that I designed and am implementing using transistors, capacitors, resistors and diodes. The goal is to make an 8-bit CPU that could be used for general-purpose computing. There are a lot of toy instruction sets floating around on the web. I chose instead to design my own, loosely based off of the PDP and 6502. It is a single accumulator design with a pair of 16-bit stack pointers and a pair of temporary 8-bit registers. Instructions are 8 bits, operands are 8 bits from memory, temporary registers or immediate, and running software can access all 16 bits of memory available to the CPU. Eventually, I want the assembled CPU along with some external RAM, ROM and a serial interface chip to be self-hosting. So, I hope to eventually have a built-in assembler or BASIC interpreter in the ROM.

## Layout

The layout is separated into logical components:

 * Microcode counter. This keeps track of what microcode in the current instruction we are operating on.
 * Instruction decoder logic. This consists of an instruction register and a series of ROM boards made out of jumpers. This uses the microcode counter as well as its own internal combinatorial logic to select one instruction and output control signals to the rest of the CPU.
 * Registers. These exist on various busses, and their input/output is controlled by the instruction decoder logic's control signals.
 * Constant circuits. These can output either a -1, a 0, or an immediate value sign extended from the current instruction register. Their operation is controlled by the instruction decoder's control signals.
 * ALU. This is actually a series of smaller components on its own internal bus. Selection of which operation as well as which input is controlled via the instruction decoder logic's control signals.
 * Flags handling. This consists of a few registers to hold flags generated by the ALU and put them on the data bus when appropriate. This is controlled via the control signal lines much like the above.
 * Memory interface. This provides the glue so that the CPU can be seen as having a set of address and data lines as well as an output enable and write enable line, much like a traditional non-SOC CPU.

### Internal Busses

 * 16-bit data bus. Most registers can only read from or write to the lower 8 bits of this bus, but some can also output their value to the upper 8 bits. Various 16-bit registers are able to read the entire 16-bit bus, and this is how the upper bits of the instruction pointer and stack pointers can be read. The lower 8 bits of this will feed the external data IO lines.
 * 16-bit address bus. This feeds the external address requests by the CPU.
 * 16-bit ALU source bus. This allows the ALU A source to be controlled, so that various 16-bit registers we want to add/subtract from don't need to be placed in a temporary location.

### Registers

 * 16-bit instruction pointer register (IP), holding the address of the current instruction in memory. Its value can be placed on the address bus or ALU input bus and it can read from the data bus. Software can jump relative to the current instruction, as well as pushing the current IP to the stack (controlled by the PC combined register), pop the IP from the stack or jump to an immediate 16 bit address.
 * 8-bit instruction register (IR), holding the current instruction that was fetched from memory. It is write-only and feeds microcode decoding logic, but can read from the data bus. Software cannot directly set this, but memory is modifiable so self-modifying code is possible.
 * 8-bit accumulator register (A), holding the current accumulated result. It can read from and write to the data bus, and it can output to the ALU input bus. Many instructions available to software can directly manipulate this register. Its value can be moved to and from the P and C registers as well as added to the combined PC register, allowing it to be used for indirect memory address modes as well.
 * 8-bit ALU temporary register (B), holding a temporary value from the bus. It can read from and write to the data bus. Its output is also hardcoded to the second input of the ALU. Software has no capability to modify this register and it is used by various microcodes to accomplish virtually all CPU operations. When the ALU is operating on a 16-bit number, the B register will be sign-extended to 16 bits.
 * 8-bit memory page register (P) and 8-bit memory cell register (C), together holding a 16-bit address. The P and C registers can individually read from the data bus, and the combined PC value can be output to the address bus or the ALU input bus. Software can write to the P and C registers from the A register and can use the combined PC register contents to load from and store to memory. The current value of the instruction pointer (IP) can be pushed to or popped from memory referred to by this register. The current value of the shadow PC combined register can also be pushed to or popped from memory referred to by this register.
 * 8-bit shadow page register (SP) and 8-bit shadow cell register (SC), together holding a 16-bit addressed referred to as SPC. This is not directly addressable, but its current value can be pushed to or popped from the location pointed at by the PC register, and a SWAP instruction allows software to swap the PC and SPC registers.
 * 8-bit CPU data register (D), holding temporary values when the CPU is pushing or popping a 16-bit value off of the stack (PC). We could use the A register for this, but I wanted to make sure that the accumulator was not clobbered when performing stack operations. This is not user readable or writeable.
 * 8-bit temporary registers (U and V), available to the programmer for various operations. These can be moved to, swapped to, loaded to and stored from, and can be used as operands for arithmetic operations against the accumulator (A).
 * 3-bit flags register, containing a carry flag (CF), a zero flag (ZF) and a shadow PC flag (PC). Software cannot directly set or clear the carry or zero flags, but both carry and zero flags are set appropriately when carrying out any ALU-based operation which sources from and stores to the A register. It is not directly readable by software but there exist skip instructions that allow software to conditionally execute a particular instruction if either CF or ZF is set or cleared. The PC flag is toggleable using a special SWAP instruction.

### Opcode Layout

The 8-bit space for a single opcode is split up in order to make it possible to decode instructions using the least amount of logic. There are some holes where future instructions might be added. For now, undefined instructions will produce undefined behavior in the CPU. As currently implemented, the control logic will output all 1's for all control signals. For this layout, the following conventions are used:

 * Register name - Register names listed directly refer to the value of that register. So, `A + 1` would refer to an operation that takes the value of A and adds 1.
 * `>` - Right carat, implies that the result of the operation on the left is stored to register/location on the right.
 * `[` and `]` - Dereference. This implies that the value of what is inside the `[]` is an address where we will store. So `1 > [PC]` implies that the value of "1" would be stored to the 8-bit memory location referenced by the PC combined register.
 * `{` and `}` - Register operand from the opcode itself. Currently, register operands are defined as follows:
   * `00` - Undefined, no register mapping.
   * `01` - U register.
   * `10` - V register.
   * `11` - SRAM pointed at by PC register.

## Design Concessions

As was the case with many 8-bit CPUs in the last century, this CPU does not have included memory, either volatile or non-volatile. It instead will assume an external chip or set of chips present on its external address and data bus. These chips, in the interest of practicality, will be standard TTL DIP package chips providing 32kb of SRAM, 16KB of ROM and 16KB of IO address space in which I am currently planning to place an 8-bit serial chip. Other plans include an LCD output and PS2 keyboard input and possibly a cartridge space to load external programs.

Due to the sheer number of parts involved in making a register, there are no scratch registers, so all intermediate values must be stored on the stack. Various operations could be sped up or made easier by lifting this limitation. Possibly in some future redesign I will implement some 8-bit scratch registers and some move operations. This would be trivial as there is room in the instruction set as well as on the data bus, but it would require a lot of additional parts and assembly for the physical registers.

Because of the complexity of designing such a system from scratch, there are a lot of inefficiencies in how the various circuits are assembled. In many cases, buffers are not actually necessary and add to propagation delay. In order to make the project manageable by a single human being, I've decided to sacrifice any sort of speed for modularity. This will result in a CPU that can theoretically only operate at a clock cycle of ~100KHz. If I was to be a lot more dilligent I could probably get this up into the several hundered or even megahertz level, but it isn't worth it.

## TODOs

 - The block diagram is far from complete. It is missing the following:
   - All ALU components.
   - Instruction decoder components for several opcode sections detailed above.
   - Detailed design of external memory interface.
 - Convenience boards, such as boards which can push a debug value onto a bus, have not been designed yet.
 - The standard library is far from complete. I am probably going to standardize on a serial chip with the VT-100 dialect and then I can code access routines for them. I also need to figure out if an assembler or BASIC interpreter will fit in ROM.
 - Several functions are missing from the current standard library:
   - 16 bit and 32 bit divide, atoi and itoa functionality.
   - signed comparison, multiplication and division functionality.
